# TEMPLATE FOR .BOOST REPOSITORY

BoostSecurity supports scanning workflows from the .boost repository, without requiring workflows to be defined in each protected repository.

The Boost service triggers the workflow defined in .github/workflows/boost.yml. The workflow file should not be modified manually.

## HOW TO USE
Create a Repository called `.boost` in Github starting from the template `https://github.com/boostsecurityio/ztp-workflow-template`
